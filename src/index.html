        </h2>
        <p class="first__stanza">
          Figure it out for yourself, my lad,<br>
          You've all that the greatest of men have had,<br>
          Two arms, two hands, two legs, two eyes,<br>
          And a brain to use if you would be wise. <br>
          With this equipment they all began,<br>
          So start for the top and say "I can."<br>
        </p><hr class="poem__rule">
        <p class="second__stanza">
          Look them over, the wise and great,<br>
          They take their food from a common plate <br>
          And similar knives and forks they use,<br>
          With similar laces they tie their shoes,<br>
          The world considers them brave and smart. <br>
          But you've all they had when they made their start. <br>
        </p><hr class="poem__rule">
         <p class="third__stanza">
          You can triumph and come to skill,<br>
          You can be great if only you will,<br>
          You're well equipped for what fight you choose,<br>
          You have legs and arms and a brain to use,<br>
          And the man who has risen, great deeds to do <br>
          Began his life with no more than you. <br>
        </p><hr class="poem__rule">
        <p class="fourth__stanza">
          You are the handicap you must face,<br>
          You are the one who must choose your place,<br>
          You must say where you want to go. <br>
          How much you will study the truth to know,<br>
          God has equipped you for life, But He <br>
          Lets you decide what you want to be. <br>
        </p><hr class="poem__rule">
         <p class="fifth__stanza">
          Courage must come from the soul within,<br>
          The man must furnish the will to win,<br>
          So figure it out for yourself, my lad,<br>
          You were born with all that the great have had,<br>
          With your equipment they all began. <br>
          Get hold of yourself, and say: "I can."<br>
